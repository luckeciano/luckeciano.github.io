Luckeciano Melo is Head of RL Research at AI Center of Excellence (previously called as Deep Learning Brazil Research Group), where he works in core research problems as well as applications for production systems within industry partners. He also works as Applied Scientist at Microsoft, working with multi-modal representation learning for web data semantic understanding.


His research focus is to develop agents that learn behaviors through interaction, in a efficient, generalist, and adaptive way.  He believes that we
can achieve this with meaningful semantic representations and world models, aligned with inductive biases on high-level cognition.
